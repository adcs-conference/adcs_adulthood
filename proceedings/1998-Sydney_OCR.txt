Message from the Programme Chairs

Welcome to the ADCS'98, the third Australian Document Computing Symposium. The ADCS series of symposia provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners in document management and information retrieval to meet and present their work. The symposium aims to cover all aspects of Document Computing - issues ranging from the fundamentals of document architectures and standards for markup, through storage, management, retrieval, authentication and workflow, to active and virtual documents.

This symposium follows the two previous symposia held in Melbourne. We have slightly altered the format of the symposium to include demonstration sessions as       as full and short papers.

All papers submitted for this symposium were submitted as complete papers and these were reviewed by three reviewers. The final programme has nine full papers, three short papers and three demonstrations.

We wish to thank the reviewers who worked to a tight schedule in reviewing the papers, giving both an assessment of each paper and helpful feedback to the authors. They are Peter           Queensland University of Technology, Stephen Green, Macquarie University, John Shepherd, University of New South Wales,       Thistlewaite, Australian National University, Wilson Wen, Telstra Research Labs, Ross Wilkinson, Mathematical and Information Sciences and Justin         Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.

Our thanks to our Organising Committee, Nick Carr, Linda         and Nghi Cao Systems, who ensured that many details of running the symposium were managed smoothly.

Abstract

In this paper we introduce a simple heuristic measure that gives higher scores to the documents where query terms co-occur in close proximity. This measure is aimed to increase performance of text retrieval by distinguishing dense regions of matching from a few matches scattered across a document. The ability to do this is important for large collections where document sizes vary significantly. We briefly discuss a few other techniques that make use of proximity information,    then introduce our method and present results of its evaluation. This evaluation shows that the method gives a considerable advantage in comparison with the cosine similarity measure.    We also have conducted additional experiments to prove that it works well in a combination with an automatic relevance feedback method.

performance of text retrieval systems on real life collections and therefore it is a promising direction of research.

A long document may contain many terms from the query under consideration. These terms may be randomly distributed in the document or they may be concentrated in a few paragraphs. In the first case the document is most likely irrelevant to the query. In the second case it is most likely relevant or, at least, a part of it is, and a good algorithm should distinguish these cases. There is strong evidence obtained experimentally that long documents may not be regarded as homogeneous objects [3].

There are working methods, like phrase search      5, 6, 7] and passage retrieval [8, 9, 10], utilizing the proximity information. These methods are widely used in commercial systems

1    Introduction

Ranked text retrieval methods (1] have received wide recognition in commercial and research systems. As the focus in information retrieval shifted from experiments with small collections of documents titles, abstracts and relatively short news articles to experiments with very large collections      of documents of various sizes, the need to take proximity into consideration became

hard to use these            for ranked text retrieval.

Phrase search is a method that allows to identify phrases and use them for indexing and search. 'The objective of phrase indexing is to identify groups of words that will enhance retrieval effectiveness when assigned as phrase descriptors to representations of documents and queries" [5]. Phrases can be identified using statistical    or    syntactic    methods.    Syntactic
