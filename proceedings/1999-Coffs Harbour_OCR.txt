Abstract

At the end of the twentieth century, documents of all kinds are available to an extent, with a degree of convenience, and for costs so low, that our forebears would be unable to believe our good fortune.

There's a common presumption that the Internet is "bringing in the millennium", and is ensuring that we achieve and sustain openness, the end of inequities in the distribution of information, democracy, and human

Any such conclusion would be premature. The digital era has ambushed and beguiled us all. Its first-order impacts are being assimilated, but its second-order implications are not. Powerful institutions perceive their interests to be severely threatened by the last decade of technological change and by the shape of the "information economy" and "information society". During the coming decade, we will see a           by those institutions, who will implement technological countermeasures, and demand and gain changes to the law.

Abstract

No standard format exists for the many academic articles available on the Web and little is known about user reading patterns. This paper explores these issues using data from two online surveys: one email-based, the other Web-based. Our results suggests that people take an overview from the screen, and then, if they are interested in an article, print it out in order to read it properly. The simple two-frame format was regarded as the best by 47% of the respondents, whereas the cascade page format was regarded as the worst by 65% of the respondents. Interestingly, 26% considered the paper-like format, widely used in Web-based articles, to be the worst. Different results were obtained when interactive examples were embedded in the survey.

Keywords: Web-based articles; Reading patterns and formats; Web-based survey; Digital library

1. Introduction

A number of Web sites exist that publish academic articles. There are no well-developed formatting guidelines for these sites and so a variety of different formats are in use. This paper presents survey information which should be useful in determining how best to format these sites.

Articles on the Web

One format being widely used on the Web is shown in Figure 1. This format is very similar to its paper-based counterpart. We chose some well-known sites in the

area: conference sites such as WWW6, WWW8 and ACM           and journal and magazine sites such as ACM SIGCHI Bulletin, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies            Alertbox and ACM Transactions on Computer Human Interaction

shows some features of article formats presented on those sites. These features can be summarised as follows:

• Abstracts are always in the articles; tables of

contents (TOC) are sometimes included;

• Scrolling is a common method of navigation; • If indexing based on a TOC exists, sliding is used

as a secondary method at some sites;

• The single window layout is most popular; and • The ACM TOCHI seems to use the Web only as

a delivery medium.

The formats of those sites are different as described. This may be due to the               different assumptions on user reading patterns. Two online surveys were carried out to investigate reading patterns and formats. Our survey participants were volunteer researchers in information technology and related areas.

Q 2 : What describes your behaviour best when y o u have an article on the Web?

(1)    You just print it out, and then read

the printed article.

(2) You read the first few lines on the

first screen, print out the article if you are interested in it,    and read the printed article.

(3) You read some concise parts such as

titles       abstracts, print out the article if you are interested in it, and read the printed article.

You scan through the article, print it out if you are interested in it,    and then read the printed article.

What could be your second choice in Q2?

article readers to the reading process shown in Figure 3. The respondents who prefer Pattern 3 appear to want to view the concise parts on the first screen. On the other hand, the respondents who prefer Pattern 4 seem to focus much more on the overall contents of an article than on its interface.

Survey conclusion

Those readers who find articles on the Web mostly take an overview from the screen, after which they print them out and read them. They seldom read entire articles from the screen. So which formats then do readers prefer and which do they dislike? The second survey answers this question.

Start reading

Methods

A Web-based questionnaire consisting of 18 questions (i.e., [6]) was developed. The first part of this questionnaire concerns the environment settings. This part controls the visual properties and the window size of a browser in terms of the amount of information amount. This helps to avoid visual volume effects when presenting interactive examples.

The second part consists of questions about three different layers: overview types, window layouts and manipulation methods. The data from this part is not discussed in this paper. The last part is about usage patterns and overall preferences in interface formats. Each question has at least one corresponding example link.

The URL for the survey questionnaire was sent by

email to 150 researchers in information technology

Results

We received 34 replies; i.e. 23% replied to the questionnaire. Most of them used 17" monitors to

applications the benefit of being online is that interactive    examples    can    be    embedded    in    a questionnaire.     These     examples     can     provide participants with a more immediate experience of the targets in question. The use of this method is not reported as yet.

Discussion

The most common usage pattern for Web-based

usage patterns of paper-based academic journals shown in [1]. This may be due to the fact that the reader's    reading    behaviour    is    guided    by    the metastructure they are used to (see       [3] for metastructure). This metastructure seems to guide

3. Web-based survey on reading patterns

and interface formats: the second survey

The previous survey revealed the common reading pattern.    A Web-based    survey,    based    on this knowledge, was also conducted. Examples were provided to    the participants    in a Web-based questionnaire, consisting of checklist style questions. Figure 6 shows a partial screen shot of the Web-based questionnaire used in the survey.

Purposes of the survey

The second survey had two purposes. One was to identify which format readers prefer and how they use it. The other was to investigate the effects of interactive examples in the questionnaire.

Like the previous email-based survey, Table 3 shows that Pattern 3 (at 56%) is the most common of the reading patterns. Patterns 2 and 4 (both 18%) were the second most common. In the previous survey, there was 0% for Pattern 2 and 32% for Pattern 4. Obviously, there is a large discrepancy between the results of the two surveys. The possible reason for this difference will be discussed in the Discussion section

The most common reading pattern for Web-based articles is for readers to look at an article in brief on the Web, and then they print it out (if they are interested in it) and then read it. The second survey produced a similar result to the first survey.

Patterns 2 and 4 revealed a big difference between the results of the two surveys. In the first survey, Pattern 4 polled 32% and Pattern 2 polled 0%. Then, in the second survey, Pattern 4 polled only 18% (a 14% decrease) while Pattern 2 polled 18% (an 18% increase). So the portions are even. Why? There was no significant difference in the distribution list and the

The survey results show the following:

of a TOC frame for navigation and a content frame for information, was the most favoured. • Providing two versions together, one in the two- frame format and the other in the paper-like-with- TOC format, seems reasonable as the preference percentage (47%) for the two-frame format is not clearly dominant over the 35% of the other.

This paper presents a              for hyper-linking documents by search-terms. Search-terms are se- lected by the user interactively building a formal concept lattice. In order to explain this interface we give some background to Formal Concept Analysis and an example is developed which illustrates the use of the concept lattice. Selected search-terms are used to create hyper-links, based on term repetition. As the               differ between queries, we need a mechanism from which to dynamically create the target hyper-linked HTML documents.    There- fore, documents are stored in a structure which is based on a word-list rather than plain text format. The documents are represented as links between the individual words within the             In so doing the word-list becomes a full-text-retrieval index into each word in each of those documents and there- fore provides a good basis for the fast creation of an HTML document set from specific queries by keywords.

To have the words in a word-list from which the documents are created also allows easy classifica- tion of words which should be hyper-linked within specific HTML documents. Furthermore, both doc- uments and hyper-linking keywords are stored as well in this structure since any word in any docu- ment is indexed by the word-list.

uses lexical chains [9] to measure the similarity between documents.     This mechanism is based on WordNet [5] and generates groups of related words within documents.     Those groups have specific meanings and can be related to groups with equivalent or similar meanings in other documents.

Our approach is query-driven and focuses on keywords. We use concept lattices as a visual in- terface so that the user can navigate to a specific subset of documents with given combinations of search-terms (or keywords) of interest. The hyper- links will be created based on repetition of those terms and will exist only between documents in the specific subset that satisfies the query.    The technique to create the concept lattices is called Formal Concept Analysis          [6].

We structure the paper with a brief introduction to FCA. Next, based on an example of a medical document-set, we demonstrate how to read a con- cept lattice and how it helps the user to identify documents of interest.    As document-sets differ, depending on the terms appearing in the concept lattice and on the selected concepts within the lat- tice, hyper-links have to be created dynamically. In Section 4, we present a mechanism to dynam- ically generate a hyper-linked document-set, wrt to a specific query, based on term repetition. The
