Abstract

•    The contextual approach considers        external data such as acquisition date, author name, file name or artificial keys [23].               this is restrictive and inappropriate for several domains such    as    Medical    Imaging,    TV    production, multimedia,       history, geology, satellite image databases, etc.

•    The    abstraction    approach    manipulates    the physical (low-level) properties of an image such as color histogram [4], texture [6, 12], shape [20. 7], edge [19, 21], etc. The abstraction approach is applied to domains where various types of images exist such as TV databases, museum databases, etc. This approach is currently having great interests because of automatic procedures used to compare images. However, abstraction approach is not appropriate in medical domain because of the diversity of the human body and the time-

remain. The main limitation conies from the ambiguities of visual languages.

3 Data model

Image    content is very rich in terms    of

characteristics.     salient     objects     and     relationships.

the medical          content represents an

aggregation of salient internal image objects:

atomic              and    anomalies.    Each    salient    object possesses low-level features             shape,          etc.) and    high-level    features    (semantic    noun,    definition, synonyms, etc.). Based upon Eakins framework        our model integrates four dimensions:

•    The    contextual    dimension    regroups    global    and external image properties (external object) without taking image's content into account.

description is not an easy task.    The

image can be described through different views: on the    basis    of either    low-level properties,    such    as texture or color; context, such as date of acquisition or author: or semantic content, such as real-world objects                     Our approach    consists providing       global description    solution capable of integrating                           (or views)    of a

Via our approach, we are able to propose a solution that takes into                 the heterogeneity      of     user     competence      (physician, researcher,    student,    etc.)    and    a    high    expressive power    for               imaging description.     Visual solutions are recommended and are the most suited for    non    "novice"    users    in    computing. However, current     visual                 suffer     from     several problems as imprecision and no respect of integrity of    spatial     relations.     Particularly, resolution     of ambiguities generated by the user and/or the

at different levels of image description    remains a challenge. In this paper, we present our solution for

We    have found that current    approaches    suffer from different weaknesses:

1-    Incomplete     description     of    image     content:     an interpretation of a satellite image of the moon may ignore other stars.

2-    Ambiguities    resulting    from    the     incompatibility

between system pertinence and user relevance.

3-    Impossibility of reutilization: a database of medical x- rays in hospital        for            cannot be reused in hospital    "B"    where    physicians    exercise    another specialty because acquisition and retrieval systems are domain-dependent.

A recent study has begun in our laboratory (LISI)

10, 11] aiming to provide an adequate image retrieval solution for heterogeneous users in the medical domain. We propose a solution built    on global description process at storage process which takes into account complexity    and    variety    of    medical    imaging

Scanner, X-rays, etc.). If image description during storage process takes into account more elements and different

consuming     procedures     required     for     each digitalization techniques (Scanner, MRI, X-ray, etc.).

»    The classification approach treats high-level properties of the image and describes its semantic content in terms of real objects and relationships. Object description and classification are generally done manually (or                        at image storage. Describing the content and the sense of each     object     is     difficult     because     probable descriptions are numerous and each person may describe the image differently. Secondly, image description     based     on     object     position     and relationships between objects (spatial facet) has proven to be imperfect at retrieval process where translation, scaling, perfect and multiple

or any arbitrary combination of transformations is applied. Thirdly, a great waste of data is induced when replacing an image by a set of poor semantic descriptors to describe image objects.

As the main objective of our project consists in

•    Each    salient    objects    can    be    mapped    into    three

orthogonal dimensions:

•     The physical dimension regroups local physical properties of image content as colors, textures and other low-level features.

•     The spatial dimension takes into consideration shapes (polygons) and spatial relations (cardinality and topology) calculated between objects.

•     The    semantic    dimension    integrates    semantic objects and relations.

4 Description process

To support our proposition, an implementation called

(Medical Image Management System) has been realized [9, 10.       The description of the whole system is out of scope of this paper. The architecture of MIMS is surveyed here below, followed by a short exposition of the topological precision of MIMS, and a description of the ambiguity resolver component.

providing retrieval medical imaging destined for non- professional end-users, user-friendly languages are required. Several language types have been proposed the last decades [2, 16, 24]. Current retrieval systems proposed in the medical domain [1, 13, 25] are not user-oriented and only few query possibilities are proposed. Visual languages can be seen as precursors in many domains applications. They aim at supplying user-friendly interfaces, especially for handling of spatial criteria in spatial queries. Several approaches have been proposed    [5, 8,    17,    22], presenting advantages and drawbacks in terms of ambiguity and user-friendliness [18]. The main advantage of visual languages comes from the fact that the user does not have any constraint to express a query and no new language to learn. Nevertheless, many limitations still

4.1    Architecture

MIMS is composed of several components (Figure 1): analyzer, ambiguity resolver, SQL Translator, and Spatial Knowledge Model (SKM). Each component has its own task. In short, the analyzer assists the user to describe the image. The ambiguity resolver checks ambiguities found in each dimension (semantic, spatial, and physical). The SQL     translator     transforms     commands     into     SQL statements. The Spatial Knowledge Model, based on Spatial Knowledge Base and the Inference Base, plays the consultant task and guides the ambiguity resolver to decide, whenever an ambiguity is found, whether the system or the user is able to respond. The analyzer, in collaboration    with    the    Spatial    Knowledge    Base    (a component of SKM), is responsible for providing possible features to describe image dimensions (spatial, physical,

semantic, and contextual). In essence, the spatial knowledge base (SKB) is a set of structures

physical, hierarchical, semantic and evolutive) that embed different medical image dimensions.

MIMS analyzer passes by several steps:

Contextual    analysis:    this    step    is used    to acknowledge the contextual dimension.

Physical analysis: this step attempts to describe physical dimension of medical image.

Spatial analysis: after physical             objects' (and regions') locations and positions can be calculated. MIMS calculates two kind of spatial relations:      directional      relations      describing cardinality (North, East, Left, Bottom, etc.) and topological     relations.     The     next     subsection describes the topological expressive power of MIMS.

4.3    Ambiguity resolver

Obviously,    certain    ambiguities    are    translated    after analysis:

•     Physical ambiguity consists in mismatching between semantic objects declared by the user and those of low-level features. MIMS does not currently have such ambiguity because manual physical dimension detection is used.

•     Semantic ambiguity occurs when semantic objects or relations proposed by the user are not identified. MIMS currently proposes to differently identify an object or to integrate it into SKB. Whenever semantic relation is defined as a set of spatial ones, ambiguities of semantic relation are resolved at spatial ambiguity level.

•     Spatial ambiguities in terms of spatial positioning. As it is known, medical objects location is so complicated to be defined. Next section details how MIMS resolve spatial ambiguities.

concepts necessary for the description of spatial data. They are preserved under topological transformations such as translation, scaling, and zooming. The

model [15] gives a formal categorization of topological relations involving two regions without holes in R 2

The existence of the inference base allows resolving certain ambiguities. The Inference base contains a set of rules used to help in decision-making. This component is upgraded manually but we are working on an automatic

•    Semantic analysis: treats semantic terms (objects and    relations)    proposed    by    the    user    during description process. Spatial Knowledge Model verification is applied during semantic dimension identification.

After semantic analysis, the system sends features to the SQL translator. The latter transforms features translated by ambiguity resolver into SQL statements and sends them to the           driver. In its turn, the JDBC driver examines SQL statements and accesses relative databases (MRI, X-rays, etc.). Figure 2 shows the analyzer's results of a description process during the storage process.

(Figure 3). A new          based upon the previous

gives    a    formal    categorization    of    all    the    possible topological relations with three spatial objects in R 2 : the

model (Figure 5).

Figure 3: The                 model [15] categorizes eight topological relations between two regions in R 2 .

A set of objects with defined binary relations can have several configurations which are not                 e.g., the two configurations of Figure 5 both have the same binary topological description <al Meet a2>     <a2 Meet a3>     <a3 Meet a l > but they are different. To make this distinction is important, especially for the medical domain which requires a high topological expressive power, e.g., the difference between two configurations for the three anomalies of Figure 5 can be crucial for the physician. The 20-lntersections model provides such a higher topological expressive power.

Figure 5: An example of three anomalies in a medical region. In the medical domain, it is crucial that the system can topologically distinguish these two configurations.

Moreover, after modification of spatial relations, it can occur that the integrity of spatial relations can be not respected, e.g.. the configuration <A Contain B> <B Contain C>     <C Disjoint A> is impossible. To respect topological integrity, we need to know the spatial expressive power of topological relations with more than two regions. The 20-lntersections model provides the needed expressive power for three regions.

5 Spatial ambiguities

The proposed interface in MIMS is hybrid (visual and textual solution), able to give accessibility to a large panel of users. The visual aspect meets important problems of spatial ambiguities. Currently, only few studies have been done    to    solve    ambiguities    in    visual    languages.    A taxonomy of ambiguities [18] shows that they are met at different levels and sublevels, making ambiguities one of the most important challenges in visual languages. A model has been formally defined in [3] for visual systems, which    handles    ambiguous interpretations of images. This formalism helps us to describe the whole visual environment and to understand where ambiguities can be found. According to the authors, a visual sentence is a triple <i.d,<int,mat» where i is an           d is a

int is an interpretation function and mat a

materialization     function.

Figure 6 shows a representation of the formalism. The image is expressed by means of a pictorial language. The description    is    expressed    by    means    of    a    description language. The functions int and mat link images with descriptions.    Several images can materialize the    same

Figure 6: Formalism of a visual

We can use this formalism to describe the whole visual environment    (Figure 7). The environment encapsulates the system and the user. These two entities communicate through an interface, including pictorial and textual languages. To allow the user to communicate    his    actions,    the    interface    provides inputs. Inputs use metaphors, e.g., the user can click on an icon. Inputs can also be geometrical

drawn by the user on the screen. The shape drawn can represent the real shape of a spatial object. In MIMS, to visually add or modify a spatial object, the user can directly act on the medical image. For instance, to add an anomaly, he can click on the medical image at the location of the anomaly. He can choose to materialize the object with an icon or a generic anomaly shape supplied by the system. The user can also add an

Several solutions are possible        The first one is that MIMS provides to the user a clear language, i.e.. a non- ambiguous textual language. After having visually added or modified spatial objects, the spatial relations derived are displayed in a textual language, in order to give a possibility for the user to check exact semantics. MIMS allows also the user to textually add and modify spatial relations.

Another solution to ambiguities is to establish a dialog with the user whenever an ambiguity occurs. For instance, in the previous example, the system shows all the available configurations and requests a choice (Figure 8).

We are currently working on integrating automatic methods able to retrieve low-level features and then to facilitate the user task.               another study is currently underway which aims to automate SKB structures.

Figure 7 shows that both user and system must interpret the interface. The ambiguity comes from the inteipretation made by the user's viewpoint as well as by the system's viewpoint. Each is capable of making several interpretations.             which inteipretation is the right one? Ambiguities can be described by the possible answers to the two following questions:

1.    How must the system interpret user actions?

2.    How must the system materialize objects and

operators to be correctly interpreted by the user?

To solve this ambiguity, the system establishes dialogs

system    for answering heterogeneous    user queries in

medical    image    databases.    Our approach consists    in

proposing a global image description to achieve an

efficient retrieval process able to mix domain and user

needs. Ambiguities resolving constitutes a big challenge in

medical interfaces where precision is so important in

The     term    frequency    used    for assigned to term weight.     is also widely recognized measuring the importance of terms in most document that terms which occur in only a       other documents categorization             ignores this important aspect. are more informative than ones that appear in many. KAN is constructed on the basis of co-occurring This consideration results in introducing the inverse terms in documents. If two tenns appear more than document frequency (IDF). These two are combined certain number of times in the same documents, they into a single value, called TFIDF [19] and this is are    considered as having    close    relationship.    This widely used for document categorization [8,        12, paper proposes    using KAN as a basis for finding 13, 22].

Term indexing has been informative terms is that a more accurate and precise studied using a growing number of statistical and meaning of a term can often be identified when machine learning techniques and is a crucial part of looking at other terms in a document.
